This repository implements a two-tier cache system optimized for LLM and agent coordination workloads.
It provides:
High-speed key–value operations (L1)
Vector and agentic search abstractions
Cross-agent, session-level provenance and coordination (L2)
The architecture enables runtime memory, deduplication, and distributed search for multi-agent or multi-LLM systems.
